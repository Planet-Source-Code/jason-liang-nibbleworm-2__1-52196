Hey look! It's nibbles! And I've added a few things...

	Green Dots: 50 points + bonus
	Red Dots: 75 points + bonus and creates a new wall block
	Yellow Dots: 100 points + bonus and slighly speeds it up

Also there are 4 speeds. Each with a different bonus.
	Slow - 0 bonus
	Medium - 25 bonus
	Fast - 50 bonus
	Ultra - ??? bonus!

And I have added 3 misc options

	Wrap - you can exit one side of the screen and come out the other, -25 bonus
		if you don't have wrap on, you will die if you run into the sides

	Go Thru Self - You can go through yourself without dying, -50 bonus

	Suicide - if you press the button opposite the direction you are going, you die!
		30 bonus

Now in version 2.0.0 (Nibbleworm 2) you can make your own levels!

	Click level editor. Click on black and the square turns red. That means it will be a wall when played. You can type in the name of the next level. If it is the last level, the name of the next level can be anything, because if it can't find the level, then it automatically thinks you beat the game. Remember to add ".jel" the end of the next level name and do not put ".jel" when you save. It does that for you. To play the level, click Play Level. If you clicked Play Level and decide not to play a custom game, click Level Editor in the main menu, and then click Quit when it pops up. It will cancel it out.
